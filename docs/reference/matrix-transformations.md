# Matrix transformations

#### m [f1] ... [f9]

Applies the specified 3x3 rotation matrix to the transformation matrix for the current state. About the argument order: [f1],[f2],[f3] defines the first row of the matrix.

```
{ m 1 0 0 0 .53 -.85 0 .85 .53 } box
```

## Translation

A translation moves every point by a fixed distance in the same direction.


## Rotation

A rotation is a transformation that is performed by "spinning" the object around a fixed point.


## Scaling

A scaling is a linear transformation that enlarges or diminishes object.
