EisenScript is a programming language designed by Mikael Hvidtfeldt for generating 3d structures.
This language shows you that even a simple system has a big possibility to generate surprising
and complex structures, and then brings a big amazing to you. A set of those structures, you would
get, has often been called ”generative art” for having both organic and mechanical in itself.
If you want to create ”generative art” intuitively, this powerful language will be your best friend.
